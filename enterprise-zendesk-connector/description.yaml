When installing Zendesk here, by this way your Airy does all the heavy lifting of connecting messaging channels while Zendesk provides you with a CRM experience that you are familiar with. After installing and configuraiton your Airy installation will automatically forward all messages to your Zendesk inbox, where you can reply to them like you are used to.</p></div>"

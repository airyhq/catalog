  Out of the box Rasa offers you a standard set of messaging channels to connect to. However, you can only connect to one Facebook page at a time. This is perfectly fine for simple use cases, but as your platform grows and you want to scale your bot interactions across many channels you will need a dedicated solution for storing and routing messages.
  This is where Airy Core can provide great scale benefits: You can connect a wide array of messaging channels and service them in a single inbox. For Rasa, you can think of it as a forward messaging router that will persist your data and make it available for export to anywhere within your organization.
